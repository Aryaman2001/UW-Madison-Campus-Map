# UW-Madison-Campus-Map

# About the app

Developed an Java application in a team of four for CS 400 group project which mapped popular campus buildings on a graph and uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to give users a estimate on how long the walk between the selected buildings are.

# What I learned

I learned to implement the graph data structure and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Working as a test engineer on this project helped me gain experience in unit testing with the JUnit framework.
